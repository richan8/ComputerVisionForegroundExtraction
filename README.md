# ComputerVisionForegroundExtraction
A program that can segment out the background and foreground using a webcam video

* This is configured to give a black and white output. Examples of its result can be found in `dataSample/test`. This can be used as gesture detection input for machine learning.

* Another use case is to modify the mask to show the original pixels instead of a constant `(255,255,255)`. This can be used for hiding backgrounds in video.
